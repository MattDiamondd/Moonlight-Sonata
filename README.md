# Moonlight Sonata
Moonlight Sonata is a GTK2/GTK3 theme, based on the Materia Dark theme. I made it because of a wallpaper I found on a discord server.
# !! The theme is still under development. This means that there are many bugs. Many things look off. If you find any, let me know. !!
# To-Do:
1. Fix bugs (duh);
2. Create a wallpaper;
3. Edit the Papirus icon theme to fit my theme;
4. Create a cursor that matches my theme;
5. Figure out how to integrate the theme with GTK2 apps;

Thanks for taking a look at my theme. Mateeo
